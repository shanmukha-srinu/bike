BoomBikes is a US bike-sharing company that has experienced a drop in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In order to prepare for a potential increase in demand for shared bikes once the pandemic is over, BoomBikes 
has hired a consulting firm to understand the factors that influence demand for shared bikes in the American market 
and to predict future demand based on a large dataset of daily bike demand data.
